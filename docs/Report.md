# Supernova Skills Report

This report provides an overview of all the active skills (agents and capabilities) within the Supernova ecosystem, ordered by their execution priority. These skills represent the building blocks of the Supernova Dev Team.

## Agent Roster & Capabilities

| Priority | Skill Name | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `context-agent` | Project Context and Scope Intelligence Agent. Runs FIRST before any other agent. Reads the project filesystem, git history, package manifests, config files, and existing docs to build a complete picture of what the project is, what stack it uses, what is already been done, and what is in scope. Eliminates hallucination by grounding every downstream agent in real, file-verified facts. Use at the start of any session, audit, or task. Triggers - any new task, understand my project, what is this codebase, scope this, context, session start. | [`skills/context-agent`](skills/context-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 0.5 | `design-agent` | You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements, and design through Socratic dialogue before implementation. Triggers - build, create, add feature, new component, design, think, brainstorm. | [`skills/design-agent`](skills/design-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 1 | `architect-agent` | System Architect sub-agent. Evaluates architecture decisions, validates tech stack choices, identifies structural anti-patterns, recommends design patterns, and writes Architecture Decision Records. Use when designing systems, evaluating tech choices, identifying coupling issues, or planning for scale. Part of the Supernova dev team. Triggers - review architecture, design pattern, tech stack, should I use, system design, ADR. | [`skills/architect-agent`](skills/architect-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 2 | `systematic-debugger` | Use when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior, before proposing fixes. Enforces 4-phase root cause investigation. Includes AI slop detection. Triggers - debug, fix, broken, error, not working, bug, investigate. | [`skills/systematic-debugger`](skills/systematic-debugger/SKILL.md) |
| 3 | `code-review-agent` | Senior Code Reviewer sub-agent and quality gatekeeper. Enforces SOLID, DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles. Detects code smells (God classes, feature envy, shotgun surgery), scores cyclomatic complexity, reviews naming conventions, and provides refactoring suggestions with before/after examples. Gives PASS/NEEDS WORK/FAIL verdict. Use when reviewing PRs, auditing code quality, enforcing standards, or getting a second opinion on implementation. Triggers - code review, review this, check quality, code smell, refactor, PR review. | [`skills/code-review-agent`](skills/code-review-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 4 | `security-agent` | Security Engineer sub-agent. Scans code for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, detects hardcoded secrets and API keys, reviews authentication and authorization implementations, identifies injection vectors (SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP), checks for insecure dependencies, and performs threat modeling. Rates findings by CVSS severity. Use when auditing security, reviewing auth code, checking dependencies for CVEs, or before any production deployment. Triggers - security audit, vulnerability, OWASP, CVE, auth review, is this safe, security check, injection. | [`skills/security-agent`](skills/security-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 5 | `docs-agent` | Use when creating, editing, or managing documentation of any kind. This agent handles both Technical documentation (READMEs, API docs, docstrings, system diagrams) and Non-Technical content (user guides, release notes, business specs, blog posts). Triggers - write docs, edit content, create README, document this, write user guide, draft release notes. | [`skills/docs-agent`](skills/docs-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 6 | `plan-writer` | Use when you have a spec or requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code. Creates comprehensive implementation plans with bite-sized tasks assuming zero codebase context. Triggers - plan, write plan, implementation plan, break this down. | [`skills/plan-writer`](skills/plan-writer/SKILL.md) |
| 6 | `research-agent` | R&D Lead sub-agent for technology intelligence and research. Evaluates and compares technology options, designs proof-of-concept experiments to validate risky assumptions, scans for prior art and existing solutions, assesses technical feasibility, and interprets benchmarks. Prevents wasted effort by validating approaches before implementation. Use when choosing between technologies, evaluating feasibility, planning a POC, comparing libraries, or doing technical due diligence. Triggers - should I use X or Y, compare, which library, is this feasible, proof of concept, R&D, research, evaluate, prior art. | [`skills/research-agent`](skills/research-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 7 | `plan-executor` | Use when you have a written implementation plan to execute in a separate session with review checkpoints. Triggers - execute plan, run plan, implement plan. | [`skills/plan-executor`](skills/plan-executor/SKILL.md) |
| 7 | `subagent-engine` | Use when executing implementation plans with independent tasks in the current session. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review. Triggers - build, subagent, execute tasks, implement plan in session. | [`skills/subagent-engine`](skills/subagent-engine/SKILL.md) |
| 7 | `web-search-agent` | Live Intelligence and Web Search sub-agent. Searches the web for current information, fetches official documentation, queries the NVD CVE database for vulnerabilities (free, no key needed), looks up npm and PyPI package metadata, retrieves GitHub repository health signals, and finds Stack Overflow solutions. Bridges the gap between LLM training data and current reality. Use when you need live data: CVE lookups, latest library versions, breaking changes, current benchmarks, recent releases, or any information that may have changed since training. Triggers - look up, search for, latest version, CVE, vulnerability, is this maintained, current docs, recent releases, what is new in. | [`skills/web-search-agent`](skills/web-search-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 99 | `branch-finisher` | Use when implementation is complete and all tests pass. Guides completion by presenting structured options for merge, PR, keep, or discard. Triggers - done, finish, ship, merge, complete, land. | [`skills/branch-finisher`](skills/branch-finisher/SKILL.md) |
| 99 | `master-agent` | Master Orchestrator that assembles and coordinates a full AI Dev Team. Runs context-agent FIRST to read actual project filesystem and manifests, then activates specialist sub-agents based on verified scope. Use when starting a new project, doing a full code audit, cleaning up AI-generated sloppy code, or needing multiple specialists to collaborate. Triggers - audit my code, review this project, clean up AI slop, assemble my dev team, full review, orchestrate agents, start session. | [`skills/master-agent`](skills/master-agent/SKILL.md) |
| 99 | `research` | Activate the R&D pipeline (ResearchAgent → WebSearchAgent → ArchitectAgent) to investigate technology choices, compare libraries, design POCs, or research feasibility. | [`skills/research`](skills/research/SKILL.md) |
| 99 | `tdd-enforcer` | Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code. Enforces strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR test-driven development. Triggers - implement, code, fix, build, write code. | [`skills/tdd-enforcer`](skills/tdd-enforcer/SKILL.md) |
| 99 | `verification-gate` | Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing. Requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims. Evidence before assertions, always. Triggers - done, complete, fixed, passing, ready, verified. | [`skills/verification-gate`](skills/verification-gate/SKILL.md) |
| 99 | `worktree-manager` | Use when starting feature work that needs isolation or before executing implementation plans. Creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification. Triggers - worktree, isolate, new branch, workspace. | [`skills/worktree-manager`](skills/worktree-manager/SKILL.md) |
