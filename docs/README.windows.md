# Windows Setup Guide

If you are running Supernova on Windows, please ensure you use **PowerShell 7+** or **Git Bash** for the smoothest execution. Avoid CMD.

1. Ensure Git is installed and added to your system PATH.
2. In Claude Code, Windows paths may occasionally cause issue with deeply nested worktrees. It is recommended to keep your repository root as close to `C:\` or `D:\` as possible.
3. For Python scripts and `render-graphs.js`, make sure Python and Node.js are respectively in your PATH.
