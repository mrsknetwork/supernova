# Supernova Testing Framework

The `tests/` directory contains the automated and manual testing scenarios designed to verify that Supernova's Dev Team agents follow their assigned skills strictly, even under pressure.

## Structure

- `claude-code/`: Execution scripts specifically targeting the Claude Code environment.
- `skill-triggering/`: Scenario prompts designed to test whether an agent automatically invokes the correct skill based on context triggers.

See the subdirectories for specific test scenarios to validate RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles, debugging techniques, and more.
